            At Pathways to Perennials Inc, we have been pioneers in the garden design and construction industry for over 40 years. Our journey began with a passion for creating beautiful, sustainable outdoor spaces that inspire and rejuvenate. As an industry leader, weâ€™ve dedicated ourselves to blending artistry with nature, ensuring every project we undertake transforms spaces into sanctuaries of peace and wellness.
  
            Understanding the profound impact nature has on well-being, it was only natural for us to expand our horizons into another realm of wellness. This led to the founding of The Toronto Sauna Co. in 2022, a subsidiary of Pathways to Perennials Inc. The Toronto Sauna Co. embodies our commitment to health and wellness, offering a complementary service that enhances the holistic benefits of our garden and landscape designs.
  
            Our saunas are crafted with the same dedication to quality and sustainability that has defined our gardening projects for decades. Manufactured in Dundalk, Ontario, our saunas are made from Canadian-sourced wood, ensuring a high standard of craftsmanship and a connection to our local environment.
  
            The synergy between the restorative power of a sauna and the holistic nature of gardening creates a unique wellness experience. Both practices encourage relaxation, rejuvenation, and a deeper connection to nature. At Pathways to Perennials and The Toronto Sauna Co., we are dedicated to fostering this harmony, helping our clients cultivate spaces that nourish the body, mind, and spirit.
